hello


226: Bryn Solomon

there are many many ways of gaining edge
you just have to think what yours is...
mine is certainly not news lol but it could be (other peoples')

note: momentum may work better with 'smaller' coins, less competitive market

spoofing is definitely going down on established crypto exchanges

Protocols / DeFi : no fees, completely unregulated. Perhaps easier to find an edge, too.
Look at Protocols:
- Uniswap
- Sushiswap


Journey Log:
- first decided to simple MACD as outlined above, on Kraken exchange
- my hypothesis: crypto (bitcoin) returns folow momentum patterns, the trick is to find the right window
- wrote infrastructure (connecting to Kraken API, sending orders, etc.)
- coded backtester for MACD strategy, downloaded historical OHLCVT data from Kraken
- playing with MACD strategy inputs (windows, periods, etc.)
- initially looked good over past year(s), but taking into account fees, were abysmal
- adjusted MACD strategy to remedy exiting positions too early before major swings
- still not ideal returns considering fees, thinking of changes
--- gas fees on DEXs are insane, so that's not really the great viable option I was imagining
- another source of worry: data. work strictly in closes, but this could be too narrow
- may have to switch from REST to WebSockets to get more continuous data
- switch into new, less competitive coins
- next idea: test out bollinger bands
- turns out that requirements for trading on margin are absolutely fucked in the us

Future Goals:
-- Finish Bollinger Band strategy
-- Investigate skyquake's advice of analyzing insto vs retail w/ histogram, use this to explore coins to trade on
-- Find way to make MACD strategy real-time on websockets (might not be enough volume to, but hey maybe try?)

- returned ranked list of best and worst performing tokens, with various MACDs(1440, 5, 20, 4)
--- out1: MACD(1440, 5, 20, 4) (year)
--- out2: MACD(1440, 12, 26, 9) (year)
--- out3: MACD(15, 5, 20, 4) (620 obs)
--- out4: MACD(1440, 20, 40, 15) (year)

we see here that 1.) 12, 26, 9 seems to be trusty, performs better than faster and slower windows,
2.) ETC is good momentum token, and 3.) very fast windows aren't too good

Looking at ETCUSD backtest (12,26,9), I've noticed:
king's ransom made on HUGE swings, on ordinary days you're losing money though

ETCUSD (4, 16, 3) performs great, veryyy twitchy
but (12, 26, 9) still better

Honestly, this is all just very chaotic: small adjustments in parameters (in windows, quantile, etc.) lead to huge differences in performance
What shines through though is that ETCUSD always performs well--> it's particularly robust

I've learned:
- Bitcoin and Ethereum don't seem to follow predictable momentum trends based on MACD and Bollinger charts (????)
- ANKR and SC are great momentum coins
- MACD doesn't behave as expected, especially during huge momentum swings punctuated by long periods of nothing
