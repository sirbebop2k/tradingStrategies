    "Let's first try a MACD-- comparing the (difference of long and short EMAs) and the EMA of this difference. We compare the difference with its own EMA because if not, there would be too many crossovers (> 0 vs < 0), and too many damn orders going through. Comparing against the EMA makes much fewer crossovers, but also means your signal is now acceleration instead of velocity [site intuition]\n",

    "We also note that if we only take the sign of the difference as our signal, we will be too late-- our signal will be incredibly lagged and we won't have the adequate time to capitalize on trends before they swing again. Comparing with the EMA of difference will make a huge difference. See below. Tho to note, the histogram is just the difference between the two...\n",
